Player Melee Combat System
Core Structure:

3 weapon categories (Heavy, Medium, Light) sharing animations within category
12 base animations per category: 4 free-flow 1H, 4 free-flow 2H, 4 parries (work for both grips)
Total: 36 core animations + 1-3 special attacks per individual weapon

Free-Flow Combat:

4 directional attacks (Up/Down/Left/Right) via blend tree + spine rotation for height/angle aiming
Mouse-driven during combat, animation override controller swaps per weapon
Stats (strength/weapon weight) affect animation speed, force output, damage, stamina cost, mobility
Mouse drag velocity modulates swing commitment: fast drag = faster swing + more damage/force + longer recovery before next attack; slow drag = normal speed + less damage/force + shorter recovery
Animation events reset speed after active swing frames (~30%), creating burst damage vs sustained DPS trade-off

Special Attacks:

Fixed combo animations (not mouse-driven), 0-1 for starter weapons, 2-3 for rare/unique weapons
Used for high-commitment punish opportunities

Parrying:

4 directional parries per category, mouse input determines direction
Must match enemy attack direction for success (stagger enemy) vs failure (take damage)

Blocking:

Shield toggle system, blocking power rating determines what attacks can be blocked
Drains stamina, provides defense without stagger

Progression:

Strength/weight ratio determines 1H vs 2H grip (get stronger → free shield hand)
Weapon durability system (Minecraft-style resource management)
Force-based weapon clashes (stronger attacks overpower weaker defenses)
