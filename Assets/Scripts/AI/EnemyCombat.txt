Enemy Melee Combat System
Core Structure:

Reuses player's 3 weapon categories (Heavy, Medium, Light) and 36 core animations
Two attack types: Basic attacks (variable/common) and Special attacks (fixed/rare)

Basic Attacks:

8 animations (4 directions × 2 grips) in blend tree, same as player
EnemyBasicAttackSO scores attack viability, then internally decides direction, torso rotation angle, animation speed via considerations or randomness
Variables can be influenced by enemy intelligence, player positioning, player defense state, environmental conditions
Most common attack type (high AI scoring priority)
Forces player to read each attack's direction/speed/height in real-time for successful parrying

Special Attacks:

Discrete fixed animations (current system), 1-3 per enemy type
Fixed direction baked into animation, more damaging/punishing
Lower AI scoring priority, but rewards player pattern recognition

Defense:

4 directional parries (can be enabled for elite/complex enemies as modular feature)
Block with shield if equipped (same system as player)
Enemy AI must detect player attacks, read direction, and time parry correctly

Stat Scaling:

Enemy strength affects damage output and force
Enemy intelligence affects basic attack decision quality (low INT = random, high INT = tactical adaptation to player behavior)

Implementation:

EnemyBasicAttackSO: New SO type for variable basic attacks (two-stage: score viability, then decide specifics)
DiscreteAttackSO: Existing system for special attacks
Both compete in AI intention scoring system
